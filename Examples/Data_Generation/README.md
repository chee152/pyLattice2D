# Data generation

Scripts used for generating the data models can be trained on. Generates randomly perturbed square, triangle, honeycomb and reentrant honeycomb lattices.

`data.py` contains the simulation code for creating random lattices and collecting their mechanical properties. `generate_all.sh` will run all the scripts to generate data for training, testing and validation splits.
